    description: |
      An <a rel="noopener" href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> plugin that
      will tell you, given the minimum Node.js version you're targeting,
      whenever you're using language and runtime APIs that aren't yet supported.
      <br><br>
      Basically, <a rel="noopener" href="https://baselinejs.vercel.app/">
      eslint-plugin-baseline-js</a>, but for a given version of Node.js instead
      of the web.

      A simple Go CLI that checks Go codebases and ensures all doc comments
      follow the official <a rel="noopener"

  - title: Justfile2Makefile

    description: |
      A simple way to convert a <a rel="noopener" href="https://just.systems/">
      <code>Justfile</code></a> to a <code>Makefile</code> or vice versa. Two
      motivations: it 1) makes it easier to switch between different command
      runners and 2) makes it possible to "run" a <code>Justfile</code> using
      Make. The latter can be useful when contributing to a project that is
      using a command runner you don't have installed – just convert it and run
      it with the command runner you have.
      <br><br>
      Now, the irony of installing some program to do the conversion instead of
      installing the command runner is not lost on me. One reason for this can
      be that the command runner is not available on the OS you're using.
      Another is that if you can convert between many formats, you only need one
      command runner and one converter, rather than many command runners.
  - title: npm audit for libraries
    tags:
      - Node.js
      - Vulnerability Management
    description: |
      An improved <code>npm audit</code> that understands libraries. That is, it
      does not complain if you depend on a vulnerable version as long as your
      consumers can upgrade to a safe version because of version ranges. This
      need not be a dedicated tool. Adding support for this to an existing tool
      could work too. Also, this idea can be applied to other ecosystems too.

      <code>@example</code>s to ensure they're correct.
  - title: Unused ESLint rule detector
    tags:
      - ESLint
      - JavaScript
    description: |
      <a rel="noopener" href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> is a linter for
      JavaScript with tons of rules and plugins with even more rules. I like to
      have all rules configured explicitly, however it can be hard to keep track
      of all rules, especially as updates come in. Hence, I'd like to have a
      tool which, given an ESLint configuration file, complains about any
      unconfigured rules.
